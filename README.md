# Splunk Configuration Language
Syntax Highlighting for Splunk Configuration Files in VS Code


## Language Grammar
The initial language grammar was gratefully taken from https://github.com/textmate/ini.tmbundle/ and extended a bit by ideas from https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/sublime-splunk-conf-highlighting/

BTW: Try TextMate on OS X :)
